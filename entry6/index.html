            <p><br><br><br>I first met Braeden at a show in my friend’s apartment over the summer. He was with a couple of his friends, completing varying years in art school, all of whom surprised me with their genuine lack of douchiness. We talked about music and photography- it’s hard for me to say that- and I knew I had found my target. For several months, I had been wanting to develop my own film, but I didn't know who to ask or where to do it. The next time I saw Braeden (hand-rolled cigarette in mouth, standing outside a record store where we had just seen a few friends play), I nervously asked him to be my darkroom sherpa. As I had expected, he agreed.

                A few weeks later, I go to his apartment, rolls of film in hand. There’s an extra room (a roommate that doesn’t move in for another month) that he’s turned into a pseudo-studio. It’s filled to the brim with different materials and supplies. In this room, Braeden churns out screen printed t-shirts, posters, and photos for the Chicago youth music scene. I feel a bit envious at the amount of things he is able to do- I want my hands to be as dirty as his. I want to accumulate enough supplies that any task I want to take on is possible with the material I have on hand. But that comes with time (and learning).

            <p>“These are all from high school,” he says as he picks through a bag of about 15 rolls of film, “they really don’t matter. I have no idea what’s on them.” He’s finding one to sacrifice to show me how to open it. We’ll do the whole process with the lights on first. He’s been doing this much longer than I have, a fact that my anxiety tells me to be true of everyone who takes photos. I often feel I am far behind the rest of the pack, a newborn babe who still drops her film off to be developed and scanned. “Did you bring the bottle opener?” Fuck. I totally forgot. Braeden says it's ok, that it will just be harder to open up the canister. He uses his swiss army knife and shows me where to pry the top of the roll off. He hands both objects over for me to try- it’s much more difficult than I thought. I struggle to keep up with conversation as I pry away at this infuriatingly tight seal. Braeden finishes it off for me, then begins to show me how to place the film on the wheels that will eventually go into the tank. I wrestle with it for a bit, Braeden noting when I’ve turned it the wrong way, but eventually get the hang of it. </p>

                “Alright, now we turn off the lights.” Braeden grabs a bath towel to cover up the light still peeking in from the blinds. I summarize the steps to him before we can’t turn on the lights again: I pry off the top of the canister, somehow find the area between the holes on either side of the film and cut it, line up the spokes on the wheel thing, feed the film into it, put it into the tank thing, and then seal it shut. He lines up everything I’ll need on the table in front of me and turns off the lights.

                <p>For several minutes I work away at getting this damn canister lid off. I should have brought that bottle opener. Braeden is a good sport and waits patiently for me to get it open. I have him check that what I’m doing is right after I finish each step (i.e, I hand whatever I’m holding to him and ask “Does that feel like I did the right thing?” and he answers “Yeah, I think so”). After I get everything into the tank, we turn the lights on and hope for the best.

                    He explains some chemistry to me about the different options for developing. We both don’t really know much about it, but he knows more than me. We decide to use a one step developer to keep things simple, then shuffle into his gross college apartment bathroom to start developing. He times me as I stir the developer around the tank, stopping every 30 seconds for 20 seconds or something like that. Then we pour out the developer and rinse off the film, hanging it up to dry.

                    As we wait, we go out to his back patio so he can have a cigarette. He offers me one, but I tell him I don’t smoke. We quickly divulge into a conversation about smoking- there’s nothing twenty something smokers love to do more than say how bad it is for them- and youth. He talks about being from Indiana and moving to Chicago, how it feels easy since so much of his family is from here. Eventually, we head back inside. The film is still drying and feels sort of sticky- Braeden says we didn’t rinse it enough. The roll of 35mm has a slight purple tint to it that he says is due to the same issue. I don’t really mind, I never expected it to be perfect. I just wanted to do it myself.

                    We talk more about ourselves, about the friends we share and the scene we find ourselves in. We have similar feelings about it which is comforting. We talk about New York and his cat, partially to kill time while the film is drying, but more so because we are still just getting to know each other. After about an hour, the film is still wet. Braeden says that it’s best not to put it in a sleeve yet as it could mess up the photos. He’ll give them to me later tonight at the party hosted at our friend's apartment. He offers to scan the film for me too, but I’m too worried the photos will be no good.
