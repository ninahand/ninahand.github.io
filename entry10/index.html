<body>
<div class="intro">
    In the spirit of being meta, I think it is only appropiate for my last entry to be about learning how to make the entries themselves.
    <br> With that being said, let's: 
    <div class="header">
        <br> <br>Learn how to code
        </div>
</div>
<div class="change">
    I started out not really knowing anything about how to code, even just html/css. While I wasn't teaching myself how to code by myself, there is definitely a level of practice and trial/error that comes with learning anything new, including coding. 
</div>
<div class="caption">
    <div class="firsttext">
        This is what I started out knowing how to do- putting words on a page without much being done to them. 
    </div>
    <div class="secondtexthide">
        Then I learned how to do some light styling- things like using web safe fonts and adding background colors. That's really it, actually. I felt discouraged because I thought it looked really ugly (it sorta did). Onwards and upwards, though. 
    </div>
    <div class="button">
        But then I learned some new things
    </div>
</div>
<div class="nextbox">
    <div class="changeagain">
         It was a small struggle every week, wrestling with the code and feeling spurned when I had to go to ChatGPT to check my code for where I was going wrong. Week by week, though, I could feel it getting easier. 
     </div>
</div>
<div class="captiontwo">
    <div class="thirdtext">
     Here, I was able to start using fonts I linked in from the internet, play with form a bit better with flex boxes, and get a bit more experimental with things like hovers and animations.
    </div>
    <div class = "buttontwo">
        More learning!
    </div>
</div>
<div class="todo">
    <div class="top">
        With that being said, here's a step-by-step I've created to help you code just like I did. Or maybe I'll use it for my future coding endeavors. Who knows.
    </div>
    <div class="one">
        <div class="rulebuttonone">
            1
        </div>
        <div class ="ruleonehide">
           Be confused in class. Feel semi-confident doing the very basics at whatever new skill you just learned. Don't think about it for long after class because you have another three hour class right after.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
        <div class="rulebuttontwo">
            2
        </div>
        <div class="ruletwohide">
            Have the confidence that you will start your coding as soon as you get home, or maybe even the next day! Never let this confidence waver, no matter how many times you wait till the weekend to start it. 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="three">
        <div class="rulebuttonthree">
            3
        </div>
        <div class="rulethreehide">
            Once you've had time to gather your materials for coding- be it having new knowledge on carving wood, playing the guitar, or otherwise- start by creating a couple text files in your desired coding program. I prefer Visual Studio Code, since the people next to me in class started using that instead of Sublime.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="four">
        <div class="rulebuttonfour">
            4
        </div>
        <div class="rulefourhide">
            Save these two files as "index.html" and "main.css". No need to deal with JavaScript for now. Now, you may have the urge to name these with more specific titles for organization purposes. But you can't! They all must be named the same thing. Which makes it super super fun when you're later referencing your own code, getting lost in the tabs that are all named the exact. same. thing. Your professor tells you this will make things confusing. Each week those tabs haunt you, and you wonder what would really happen if you change them. But you decide to trust her. 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="five">
        <div class="rulebuttonfive">
            5
        </div>
        <div class="rulefivehide">
            Pat yourself on the back for doing that. That's a start! Now time to put it off for a little more. Not necessarily because you dread doing it, but you know you must rest before even an easy battle.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="six">
        <div class="rulebuttonsix">
            6
        </div>
        <div class="rulesixhide">
            It's time to begin. You start off with the header, since you get to have fun scrolling through Adobe Fonts, finding the best one that will match your theme for the week (without being too cliche). You link everything together, make it a change a tiny bit when you hover over it. It's the little things. 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="seven">
        <div class="rulebuttonseven">
            7
        </div>
        <div class="rulesevenhide">
            It's time for a flexbox. Breathe in, breathe out. This could only go one of two ways: it will either be the easiest thing you've ever done, or will torture you until it's time to go to bed. A friendly flexbox will make you feel like you could easily pursue a degree in computer science. An angry one will push you to the throws of ChatGPT, forcing you to question your morals, even if you are just using it as a proof reader or as a way to help iron out a new skill. "Am I creating my own future demise?" you may wonder. "No,"" you tell yourself, "it's just a tool." We all have to sleep somehow.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="eight">
        <div class="rulebuttoneight">
            8
        </div>
        <div class="ruleeighthide">
            After wrestling with flexboxes, oversized images, and unresponsive font changes, you've finally made it through. Commit your code to your main on Github, and then push it to the origin. Try to explain to your roommate who is vaguely interested what that means and how Github works. Settle on an explanation that wouldn't make sense to anyone who actually knows what they're talking about.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="nine">
        <div class="rulebuttonnine">
            9
        </div>
        <div class="ruleninehide">
            Commit more code because you forgot something last time. Whoops forgot again. Oh! And you forgot to fix that other thing. There's a typo- you have to reuplaod it. Ok and another one there in the third paragraph. Oh and-
        </div>

        <div class="ruletenhide">
            Open up your Github link and give a nice sigh. While it's not a perfect website, and not nearly what you imagined it to be, it's something you've created out of skills you are learning. And it looks pretty good! Send the link to your Dad- he always wanted one of his kids to be a computer science major, but this is the closest he'll get. 
        </div>

<div class="outro">
    Well! Hope that's helpful. To you now and in the future. I had fun making this website, despite or maybe even because of all of the challenges. Feels like I learned something, you know? Probably because I did. Soon I'll have the knowledge that will let me get a bit more experimental with the form of this all, but for now this little webpage does the trick. Cheers.
