        <h1>How to Take Pictures</h1> <h2>with me (Nina) </h2>
        <p>A couple weekends ago, I went to Connecticut with a handful of friends. We spent a couple days there, not doing much else other than walking around and making dinner.
            <br><br><br>
            We spent hours walking along a beach, many of us with cameras in hand. I brought a TLR I  bought at the Chelsea Flea over the summer for $20. I'd only used it once before,
            so I was still gettting comfortable with operating it. So I was really excited when, about a week later, I got the photos developed and they all turned out beautifully.
            <br><br><br>
            It felt like a really successful moment, to be able to look at all the photos I took and be happy with them all. They all are exposed correctly, compositionally pretty sound, and 
            evoke the feeling I want to have present in all of my photos.
            <br><br><br>
            These photos prompted me to think about how my photography has progressed over the last couple years. 
            <br><br><br>
            I realized that photography is something that I've almost completely taught myself how to do. I had been interested in film photography for a bit, but started to actually try it out during my senior
            year of high school, when I started to date someone who took a lot of photos.
            <br><br><br>
            I mentioned my interest in this to my dad, and after a quick dig through the closet in our basement, I suddenly had a camera in my hands.

    My first camera was my dad's old Minolta point and shoot. The auto focus was weak, to say the least, and it was anyone's guess when the flash would go off.

        I wanted to be good at taking photos, but I really wasn't.

        I kept shooting though, and the next roll of film saw a lot of improvement. I didn't understand anything about how the camera actually worked,
        but I tried to actually think about what I was taking photos of.

        After this point, I got a lot better. I was shooting much more and beginning to understand how cameras actually worked. I got a Canon Ae-1 as a gift for Christmas
        which allowed me to really think about things like exposure as I took my photos. I noticed that I liked taking pictures of my friends, and found taking photos of anything else 
        quite bored me. I shot in black and white, taking a note from my ex who said that it helped them to focus on composition/subject instead of color.

        At this point I started to experiment with doing shoots. Instead of having one roll of film I was using up slowly, I would go out with a friend or two and try to finish the roll all within one session.
        I found this helped me practice my composition/posing and learn how to make photos interesting both individually and collectively. I also got a new camera (the TLR mentioned above) that required even more 
        manual control than my Canon. This helped me be really intentional as I took photos.

    That leaves us here, sort of. There are lots of photos I couldn't include- I'm trying to not crash Github.
    And while I know for every good photo, there's a dud-
