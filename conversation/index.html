            But what I don’t like– and what I don’t think either Seymour or Buddy would like, either, as a matter of fact–
            is the way you talk about all these people. I mean you don’t just despise what they represent– you despise them.
            It’s too damn personal, Franny. I mean it. You get a real little homicidal glint in your eye when you talk about
            this Tupper, for instance. All this business about his going into the men’s room to muss his hair before he comes
            in to class. All that. He probably does– it goes with everything else you’ve told me about him. I’m not saying it
            doesn’t. But it’s none of your business, buddy, what he does with his hair. It would be all right, in a way, if you
            thought his personal affectations were sort of funny. Or if you felt a tiny bit sorry for him for being insecure
            enough to give himself a little pathetic goddam glamour. But when you tell me about it– and I’m not following,
            now– you tell me about it as though his hair was a goddam personal enemy of yours. That is not right– 
            and you know it. If you’re going to go to war against the System, just do your shooting like a nice, intelligent girl–
            the enemy’s there, and not because you don’t like his hairdo or his goddam necktie.
            <br><br><br>
            It’s exactly like this damned ulcer I picked up. Do you know why I have it? Or at least nine-tenths of the reason I have it? 
            Because when I’m not thinking properly, I let my feelings about television and everything else get personal. I do exactly the
            same thing you do, and I’m old enough to know better.
            <br><br><br>
            This last thing will probably cause an explosion. But I can’t help it, It’s the most important thing of all.
            <br><br><br>
            I don’t know if you remember, but I remember a time around here, buddy, when you were going through a little apostasy from 
            the New Testament that could be heard for miles around. Everybody was in the goddam Army at the time, and I was the one that
            got his ear bent. But do you remember? Do you remember it at all?
            <br><br><br>
            <span class="franny">I was all of ten years old!</span>
            <br><br><br>
            I know how old you were. I know very well how old you were. C’mon now. I’m not bringing this up with the idea of throwing 
            anything back in your teeth– my God. I’m bringing this up for a good reason. I’m bringing it up because I don’t think you
            understood Jesus when you were a child and I don’t think you understand him now. I think you’ve got him confused in your 
            mind with about five or ten other religious personages, and I don't see how you can go ahead with the Jesus Prayer till you 
            know who’s who and what’s what. Do you remember at all what started off that little apostasy?... Franny? 
            Do you remember, or don’t you?
            <br><br><br>
            Well, I do, it happens. Matthew, Chapter Six. I remember it very clearly, buddy. I even remember where I was. I was back in my room
            putting some friction tape on my goddam hockey stick, and you banged in– all in an uproar with the Bible wide open. You didn’t 
            like Jesus any more, and you wanted to know if you could call Seymour at his Army camp and tell him all about it. And you know why 
            you didn’t like Jesus any more? I’ll tell you. Because, one. You didn’t approve of his going into the synagogue and throwing all the
            tables and idols all over the place. That was very rude, very Unnecessary. You were sure that Solomon or somebody wouldn’t have 
            done anything like that. And the other thing you disapproved of– the thing you had the Bible open to– was the lines ‘Behold the 
            fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.’ That 
            was all right. That was lovely. That you approved of. But, when Jesus says in the same breath, ‘Are ye not much better they?’– 
            ah that’s where little Franny gets off. That’s where little Franny quits the Bible cold and goes straight to the Buddha, 
            who doesn’t discriminate against all those nice fowls of the air. All those sweet, lovely chickens and geese that we used 
            to keep up at the Lake. And don’t tell me again that you were ten years old. Your age has nothing to do with what I’m talking
            about. There are no big changes between ten and twenty– or ten and eighty, for that matter. You still can’t love a Jesus as
            much as you’d like to who did and said a couple things he was at least reported to have said or done– and you know it.
            You’re constitutionally unable to love or understand any son of God who throws tables around. And you’re constitutionally unable
            to love or understand any son of God who says a human being, any human being– even a Professor Tupper– is more valuable to God
            than any soft, helpless Easter chick.
            <br><br><br>
            <span class="franny">I suppose you can!</span>
            <br><br><br>
            It’s besides the point whether I can or not. But, yes, as a matter of fact, I can. I don’t feel like going at it, 
            but at least I've never tried, consciously or otherwise, to turn Jesus into St. Francis of Assisi to make him more ‘lovable’– 
            which is exactly what ninety-eight per cent of the Christain world has always insisted on doing. Not that it’s to my credit.
            I don’t happen to be attracted to the St. Francis of Assisi type. But you are. And, in my opinion, that’s one of the reasons
            why you’re having this little nervous breakdown. And especially the reason why you’re having it at home. This place is made
            to order for you. Ther service is good, and there’s plenty of hot and cold running ghosts. What could be more convenient?
            You can say your prayer here and roll Jesus and St. Francis and Seymoour and Heidi’s grandfather all in one.
            <br><br><br>
            Can’t you see that? Can’t you see how unclearly, how sloppily, you’re looking at things? My God, there’s absolutely nothing
            tenth-rate about you, and yet you’re up to your neck at this minute in tenth-rate thinking. Not only is the way you’re going
            about your prayer tenth-rate religion but, whether you know it or not, you’re having a tenth-rate nervous breakdown. I’ve
            seen a couple of real breakdowns, and the people who had them didn’t bother to pick and choose the place they–
