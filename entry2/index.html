	<h3>Wood Carving with Elle</h3>
	<br>
	<h5>
		“I just carve out of here,” she says as she slides the window up next to her bed. <br>
	</h5>
	<h6>
		She lets the shreds of wood fall out the window and down five stories into the courtyard below. <br>
		I don’t feel too bad about it- I don’t think tenants have access to this side of the building. <br>
		It’s sort of poetic to see her there, sitting by the window carving wood. <br>
		“I like to do things the way they would’ve been done a long time ago.” I understand, there’s something about doing something so manual. <br>
		Somehow it feels like the pushes forward in what you are doing are even more dependent on the self. <br>
		Elle says that they think less when they are making art with their hands instead of that “hypothetical bullshit”. <br>
		At first I am confused, but they explain how just being able to focus on what is happening right in front of them <br>
		means they don’t get caught up in all the theoreticals that are tied to other kinds of art. <br>
		<br>
	</h6>
	<h5>
		“The whole thing is like picking”, she tells me. <br>
	</h5>
	<h6>
		We both like to pick. It’s something I’m embarrassed of and something I want to stop doing. She wants to stop too. <br>
		She and I both pick our faces a lot, making our faces bleed when we accidentally go too deep.<br>
		I’m constantly picking my lips and my arms too. Maybe having a new outlet for something to do with my hands will help. <br>
		<br>
	</h6>
		
	<h5>
		“Wait, stop,” she says as she laughs sheepishly, “I was gonna make a cup out of that.” <br>
	</h5>
	<h6>
		Suddenly I can see the progress she was making on the piece of wood I was practicing on. <br>
		The curved bottom leading towards a rim. I find it interesting how the form slowly begins to show itself. <br>
		That the shape is only apparent to the maker until suddenly it is apparent to everyone. I want to make a spoon, I think, but I need to get proper wood. <br>
		The new piece of wood I’m practicing carving on is a leg of our other roommate’s broken bed frame. <br>
		<br>
	</h6>
	<h5>	
	“It’s good to have your hand move along the wood. What you want, or what I think you want, I don’t actually know-” Elle continues on. 
	</h5>
	<h6>
		She taught herself how to wood carve last year for a class project. We would both be doing work by the measly light bulb into our dorm desks,<br>
		facing away from each other, and I would turn around to see her hunched over, chipping away at a piece of wood. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

	<h5>
		A few days later, </h5>
		<h6> I go into Blick and buy myself some wood. I'll use Elle's carving tools at home. I go into the wood shop at school to cut <br>
		the piece I got in half. It's my first time using a big machine like that alone, so I'm a little nervous. My cut is easy though- straight down <br>
		the middle- so I know there's nothing really to be nervous about. <br>
		<br>

		Armed with my new knowledge, I begin to carve my spoon. I'm less intimidated now, knowing Elle taught herself and that shes just a hallway
		away if I need any guidance. <br>
		<br>

		Talk soon, hopefully with a new wooden spoon in hand. <br>
