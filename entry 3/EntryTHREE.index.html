<h2> SASHIKO MENDING</h2>
<h3> with Paul</h3>
<div>
<p>
    <br>
    <br>
    Most times when I ask Paul what he did over the weekend, he’ll say “I watched movies and sewed these pants”. 
    He’ll elaborate on the movie part, <br>delving into his opinions on the actors and the director and countless other things 
    about movies I don’t know anything about. Sometimes I’ll ask questions in an attempt to keep up with him; other times I’ll just nod.
    When he says he sewed though, I know exactly what he means- he mended someone's pants with Sashiko sewing.<br>
    <br>
    Paul is always working on mending something for someone else. When I hang out with his friends, I can see his handiwork on their clothes, <br>
    often pants. The small white stitches, either horizontal lines or crosses, are unmistakable amongst friends as his work.
    I’ve given him a couple  <br>pairs of jeans myself, after constant wear led to holes along the pockets.<br>
    <br>
    I’ve sewn in bits and pieces throughout my life, at times more so than others. I tend to stick to machine sewing,
    but something about mending feels much more intentional when done by hand. Intentional isn’t the right word. Tender? True to its nature?
    When my pair of jeans that are probably the single most worn item in my closet began to form a hole,
    I brought them to Paul to show me how to mend. <br>
    <br>
    He hands me a piece of blue and white fabric that he uses when mending. “Is it ok if I use it?’ I ask, “I know it's your nice fabric.” <br>
    He says it's fine, since it won’t need that much. He got this fabric somewhere, somehow. It has some sort of meaning, some purpose,  <br>
    like most things Paul has/does. Deadstock something. </p> </div>

        <p> Paul says he doesn’t believe in pinning when I ask him if I should pin the fabric in place. He says he also doesn’t believe in machines 
            when I ask him why he doesn’t do this on a sewing machine (Note: later, when his roommate and best friend Clyde returns home and I tell him
            of Paul’s comment, Clyde says “You don’t believe in machines? Your computer is a machine!” Paul is a gamer). 
            He says that is the point of Sashiko- to be done by hand. Sashiko is a type of traditional Japanese embroidery 
            (I understand the irony of an Italian American teaching me this technique) that first originated during the 1600s, though it became more
            established in the 1850s when it was used to mend farming workwear made of denim. Sashiko is recognizable by its 
            white stitching contrasting the blues of the denim it was mending, hence the blue and white fabric to patch with. </p>

    “Sashiko is about giving power to an item,” Paul tells me. I’m sitting on the floor of his living room, he’s sitting at the dining table.
    By putting time and care into every stitch, you give it irreplaceable value. Paul explains the whole idea that farmers would wear 
    the same pants every single day,  <br>creating an inescapable cycle of repair. They started to mend things before they even began to fray,
    building layers upon layers of patched denim.  <br> He pulls up a picture to show me. “The idea is that you have endless layers of denim, 
    that this one pair of jeans will last you a lifetime.” We talk about trends. I think mending has become a trend in the way that 
    reading has become a trend. “Sort of like ‘clean girl’. I mean, if anything should be a trend, it’s reading and mending things. 
    But it’s still just unreasonable expectations for yourself that you see people posting on social media.”  <br>Paul says that the trend of 
    mending came with thrifting- I disagree. But maybe we’re both wrong, and it’s just a change in mindset of our generation,  <br> at least for now.
