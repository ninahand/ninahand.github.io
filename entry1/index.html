	   <h4>These days, it seems as though every time I meet someone and tell them I'm in art school
I must have an answer to the ever-pervasive question: <h4>
   
	   <h3> What do you make? <h3>
	
	   <h4>I struggle to find an answer.


     		I like to take photos,

     						but that doesn't make me anything other than a grandma.





     		I listen to a lot music 
     		and like to pretend to know what I'm talking about when discussing it with other people,

     						but I stopped playing when I was young.



     I like to do a lot of things,

     but none of them are what I do per say. 

     I'm not really ready to settle into a "medium",
     and I want to learn about so many things. 

     And who better to learn these things from than from my friends?
     <h4>
    <h3>
     So if you want to learn how to carve wood
                                    play chess
                                    make a ceramic bowl
                                    write a song
                                    give someone a tattoo
                                    and probably many other things, 

     You're in the right place.
