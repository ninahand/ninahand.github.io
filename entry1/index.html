I must have an answer to the ever-pervasive question: <h4>

     		I listen to a lot music 
     		and like to pretend to know what I'm talking about when discussing it with other people,

     						but I stopped playing when I was young.



     I like to do a lot of things,

     but none of them are what I do per say. 

     I'm not really ready to settle into a "medium",
     and I want to learn about so many things. 

     And who better to learn these things from than from my friends?
     <h4>
    <h2>
   So if you want to learn how to carve wood
                                  mend your clothes
                                  rock climb
                                  play guitar
                                  develop film
                                  give someone a tattoo
                                  make a ceramic bowl
                                  and probably many other things,
