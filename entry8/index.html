        When was the last time you learned something new?

        I think that's pretty normal. It was sort of how I was feeling in the spring. Though I was in art school and making a lot of things, it felt like I hadn't actually gained a new skill in a long time. I kept thinking of the things I wanted to learn how to do, and had wanted to learn for a long time, pushing them off until I had more time. Finally, over the summer, I took more action and started to teach myself things. I bought a cheap guitar off Facebook marketplace and scoured the internet for the least expensive pottery class I could take. If you want to read about it, one of these entries is about me asking someone I barely knew to teach me how to develop film. It felt good to take action in this way. Maybe you could try it too. Imagine if you did...

        Well that's good! Then we're in the same boat. That is, depending how you feel about the whole situation...

    <div class="secondquestion">
        How did you feel about the learning curve when learning this new thing?

        This is how I felt too. It sucks to be bad at something- it's super frustrating. I remember one time saying this to someone I may or may not have been interested in, and they said "Uh, I think everyone feels that way." It was then I realized that this feeling isn't an excuse to not learn something new: it is an encouragement to learn something new. Learning to be okay with not being necessarily good at something is hard, but I think it could open up a lot of things for me. So far, it has.

    <div class="goodwords">
        Okay. Fine. Good for you. Then you know that it is a really powerful feeling to be so okay and maybe even content with being bad or just mediocre at something. I'll feel the same soon, maybe even in just a second.
